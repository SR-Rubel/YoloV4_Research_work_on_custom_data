# INTRODUCTION:
In any urban area traffic congestions are increasing day by day. It is becoming harder to manage the traffic
system in developing countries. In Southeast Asia Dhaka city is facing severe crisis with currently average
traffic speed of 6.4 kmph. In upcoming year's it will be difficult to manage the traffic problems. To solve this
problem we can use AI-based traffic control systems.
Object detection in deep learning is most popular topic in recent periods. Various types of object detection
algorithms were introduced by many researchers and they are able to yield remarkable results. However, most
of them fail when it comes to detecting overlapping and small objects in images and thatâ€™s why it is very
challenging task in urban area like Dhaka city to detect multiple overlapping vehicles.
The purpose of this paper is to train a vehicle detector using YOLOv3, YOLOv4, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN
and EfficientDet methods and make experimental analysis comparison between them with the result obtained
from these methods. In addition, we tried different settings and approaches to maximize the result
